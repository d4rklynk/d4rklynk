### Hello friend üëãÔ∏è

I'm the creator of [SimplePrivacy.fr](https://simpleprivacy.fr) which is a french website. I operate several services which you can find [here](https://services.simpleprivacy.fr/).

I'm hanging around a lot in [PrivSec chat](https://invite.arcticfoxes.net/#/#PrivSec.dev:arcticfoxes.net), you can reach me here if you want to.

Even if I work in IT, I'm mainly a nerd, and just want to learn stuff from others.

And yes, I'm a big fan of [Mr.Robot](https://youtu.be/N6HGuJC--rk) because fsociety.
